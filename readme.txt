Enables your content and visitors' input to create engaging videos.

== Description ==

The Moovly Wordpress Plugin will allow you to generate videos from your existing/new posts, which can be used in the
same post that is used to generate said video. We'll use your title, content (up to the <!---readmore---> line) and
your featured image to fill a template(s) of your choice. If you want to spruce up your post with that video, use the 
[moovly-post-video] shortcode.


If you want to engage your visitors, you'll definitly love our [moovly-template] shortcode. We'll generate a form based on your
template settings and when your visitor enters his/her/x information, they'll be presented a video with their content.

            Create a suitable Project in Moovly, that has at least two template variables: "post_title", and
            "post_content".

            <a href="https://developer.moovly.com/docs/integrations/wordpress">More info at our docs</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            Save that project as a Template
          </li>
          <li>
            Go to the Moovly WordPress plugin Templates page. Select the template you just created.
          </li>
          <li>
            Create a WordPress post. It does not matter which category or tag it has. If you want to inject the video,
            even before it has been created, use the [moovly-post-video] shortcode.
          </li>
          <li>Come back here and see the status of your first post video.</li>
